# Introduction: Creating a Car-Pooling Platform üöó
Welcome to my Car-Pooling Platform, a microservices-based solution for efficient and convenient carpooling service for users! This platform caters to two primary user groups - passengers and car owners. 

During the creation of a user account, a default passenger profile is created where first name, last name, mobile number, and email address are required. For a user who is also a car owner, the default passenger profile can be changed to a car owner profile. 
The user is required to provide a driver‚Äôs license number and a car plate number. Subsequently, users can update any information in their account. Users are able to delete their accounts after 1-year if the car-pooling platform is no longer relevant to them. The 1-year data retention is for audit purposes.
Users who are car owners publish car-pooling trips with addresses of pick-up locations, alternative pick-up locations, start traveling time, address of destination and number of passengers their car can accommodate. 
When trips are published, car owners wait for passengers to select and enrol for respective trips.
The platform assigns seats based on a first-come-first-serve basis. The car owners will be able to start trips or cancel them 30 minutes before the scheduled time. 
Passengers can search and browse through a listing of published trips and enrol to any published trips as long as there are vacancies, and no date and time conflicts with enrolled trips. 
Users can retrieve all trips that have taken before in reverse chronological order. 

## Objectives üéØ
1. Demonstrate Ability to Develop REST APIs: Showcase your proficiency in designing and implementing RESTful APIs.

2. Conscientious Consideration in Designing Microservices: Develop microservices with careful consideration, adhering to best practices in design and architecture.

## Design considerations

* For my design considerations,  after reading through the requirements, I had to implement a **2 tiered microservice** architecture with implementation of a persistant storage. I identified key entities and business capabilities in the system that I have created, such as Users and Trips. I have created 2 separate microservices for each entity or business capability to achieve a modular and scalable architecture.
  
* For **User Service**, it is responsible for managing user information and will be exposed to endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving user details. Ensured proper validation of user data during creation and update. Likewise for **Trip Service**, it manages information related to carpooling trips.It will be exposed to endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving trip details. Implemented logic to enforce business rules, such as ensuring a car owner is valid and that trip times are in the future.
  
* **Data Storage:** For my database, I used a singluar mysql database that has 2 tables, for users and trips.
  
* **Communication between Microservices:** Used RESTful APIs for communication between microservices.Implemented proper error handling and response codes.
  
* **Event Sourcing and Logging:** Consider implementing event sourcing for tracking changes in state. Implement logging for each microservice to capture important events and errors. 
  
* **Error Handling and Resilience:** Implement proper error-handling mechanisms in each microservice. Use Circuit Breaker patterns to handle faults gracefully and prevent cascading failures. Implement retries for transient failures and timeouts so that code will still be able to function even though a functionality cannot be used.
  
* **Validations for various functions:** I have added validations such as booking and cancelling the trip only can be done 30 minutes after the trip has been created. If trip has started, users will not be able to start the trip again. Also, i ensured that users can only delete their created user after 1 year based on the requirements. In addition, i made sure that the user ID of created users cannot be replicated and when users try to create trips, a valid user ID must be used, thus the program will check for whether the user is a car owner before creating the trip.


## Architectural Diagram üìê

Explaination: This diagram showcases my microservice carpooling application which contains 2 programs, one program is for my server side program (main.go) which help to connect the program to the datbase and use REST API to communicate with the server to allow for GET, POST and PUT methods for various functionalities. The other program (console.go) is my client side program which acts as as "Admin console" to allow users to interact with the program and allow to handle user inputs based on the functionalities in main.go. The program will begin with the execution of main.go which will send its packets over to the client, once received its call, the client side program will be able to call the server side program main.go to allow the REST endpoints to be activated.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started 
*  **Note: You can use whatever way to initalise your repository AS LONG AS you have server and client program each. Naming conventions such as main.go and console.go is up to you. (I named mine as mainsub.go and consolesub.go)**
* **Also, my codes uses a map as stroage as the implementation of database has issue**

* <br>

1. Create 2 speperate folders to contain your server program (main.go) and Admin console program (console.go)
  
2. Initalise your repository using the cmd prompt:
```sh
go mod init main.go/console.go
```
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
3. Import the necessary packages in main.go:
* gorilla mux
```sh
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
```

* mysql
```sh
go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

3. Setting up your database:
   
Create user:
```sql
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost'
```

Create database:
```sql
CREATE database carpooling;
USE carpooling;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(255),programmes
    last_name VARCHAR(255),
    mobile_number VARCHAR(20),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    driver_license VARCHAR(255),
    car_plate_number VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create the 'trips' table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS trips (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    car_owner_id VARCHAR(255),
    pickup_location VARCHAR(255),
    alternative_pickup VARCHAR(255),
    start_travel_time TIMESTAMP,
    destination VARCHAR(255),
    available_seats INT,
    creation_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    cancellation_time TIMESTAMP
);
```

4. Run main.go using the following command
```sh
go run main.go
```

5. Run console.go using the following command
```sh
go run console.go
```

6. Now you will be able to use the application.

## Prerequisites

* You should be able to set up your go lang project locally by using the **"go mod init" command**.

* If you face any issues, please head over [this website](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) on how to create a local Go program.

* **mysql workbench** should be installed


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The usage can be found in the video link below:

Do take note that installing mysql is not necessary for this project as i did not use a database to store user and trip information. I used a map instead  that acts as a session state. Once main.go ends the program, all data will be deleted!!!
